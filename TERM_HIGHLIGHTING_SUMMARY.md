# Interactive Term Highlighting Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added an intelligent term extraction and highlighting system that makes technical content more accessible by providing interactive tooltips for pesticides, fungicides, treatments, and other agricultural terms.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **API Endpoint**: `/api/extract-terms`
- **Location**: `app/api/extract-terms/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Extracts technical terms from disease analysis content
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: Combined content from all analysis sections
- **Output**: JSON array of terms with definitions, usage instructions, and categories
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "terms": [
    {
      "term": "Copper fungicide",
      "definition": "A protective fungicide containing copper compounds...",
      "usage": "Apply as foliar spray at 2-3g per liter...",
      "category": "fungicide"
    },
    {
      "term": "Neem oil",
      "definition": "Natural pesticide extracted from neem tree seeds...",
      "usage": "Mix 5ml per liter of water and spray on affected areas",
      "category": "pesticide"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **HighlightedText Component**
- **Location**: `components/highlighted-text.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Renders text with interactive term highlighting
- **Features**:
  - Smart regex-based term matching (case-insensitive)
  - Avoids highlighting inside HTML tags
  - Prevents overlapping highlights
  - Longest-term-first matching to avoid partial matches
  - Beautiful hover popovers with term details
  - Color-coded category badges

**Visual Styling:**
- Underlined text with dotted decoration in primary color
- Hover reveals popover with:
  - Term name
  - Category badge (color-coded by type)
  - Definition
  - Usage instructions (if applicable)

**Category Colors:**
- 🔴 Pesticide: Red
- 🟠 Fungicide: Orange
- 🔵 Treatment: Blue
- 🟢 Nutrient: Green
- 🟣 Practice: Purple
- ⚪ Condition: Gray

### 3. **Detector Component Integration**
- **Location**: `components/detector.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Added `ExtractedTerm` interface for type safety
  2. Added state for extracted terms and extraction status
  3. Integrated term extraction in completion workflow
  4. Replaced all `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with `<HighlightedText>` component
  5. Added visual notifications for extraction progress

**Workflow:**
1. User analyzes an image
2. Disease detection completes
3. All 6 AI content sections generate (Info, Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, Prevention, Alternatives)
4. When all sections complete → automatically trigger term extraction
5. API extracts terms from combined content
6. Terms are highlighted across all sections
7. User can hover over any highlighted term to see details

### 4. **User Notifications**
Three notification states:
1. **Extracting Terms** (Blue): Shows while API is processing
2. **Terms Highlighted** (Purple): Shows when extraction completes with count
3. **Auto-hide**: Success notification disappears after 5 seconds

## Performance Optimizations

### Single API Call Strategy
- ✅ Only **1 API call** after all content generates
- ✅ Avoids 6 separate calls (one per section)
- ✅ Gemini can see full context and avoid duplicates
- ✅ Terms appear all at once for better UX

### Smart Text Parsing
- Sorts terms by length (longest first) to prevent partial matches
- Tracks highlighted ranges to avoid overlaps
- Skips highlighting inside HTML tags
- Case-insensitive matching

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. ✅ Upload an image with a disease (e.g., Anthracnose)
2. ✅ Wait for analysis to complete
3. ✅ Verify "Extracting Terms..." notification appears
4. ✅ Check console for term extraction logs
5. ✅ Verify terms are underlined in all sections
6. ✅ Hover over highlighted terms to see popovers
7. ✅ Check popover content (definition, usage, category)
8. ✅ Verify category badges are color-coded correctly
9. ✅ Test with healthy plant detection
10. ✅ Test with low confidence (< 80%) to see alternatives section

### Edge Cases:
- ✅ No terms found: Falls back to regular text rendering
- ✅ Empty content: Skips extraction gracefully
- ✅ API error: Logs error but doesn't break UI
- ✅ Duplicate terms across sections: Highlighted consistently

## Benefits

### For Users:
- 📚 **Educational**: Learn about treatments while reading
- ⚡ **Quick Reference**: No need to search for term meanings
- 🎯 **Contextual**: See definitions right where they're mentioned
- 🔍 **Discoverable**: Underline makes terms obvious

### For Developers:
- 🧩 **Reusable**: HighlightedText component can be used anywhere
- 🎨 **Customizable**: Easy to adjust styles and categories
- 🚀 **Performant**: Single API call, efficient regex matching
- 🛡️ **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Click to Copy**: Let users copy term info
2. **External Links**: Link to detailed resources
3. **Pronunciation**: Audio pronunciation for scientific names
4. **Favorites**: Save commonly needed terms
5. **Search**: Filter/search extracted terms
6. **Analytics**: Track which terms users interact with most

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `app/api/extract-terms/route.ts` (API endpoint)
- `components/highlighted-text.tsx` (Component)
- `TERM_HIGHLIGHTING_SUMMARY.md` (This file)

### Modified:
- `components/detector.tsx` (Integration + 6 rendering updates)

## Configuration Required

Ensure `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`:
```bash
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Console Logs to Watch

```
🔍 Extracting technical terms from content...
✅ Extracted 8 terms for highlighting
```

Look for these in the browser console during analysis.
