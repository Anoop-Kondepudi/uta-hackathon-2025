# Model Compatibility Issue - Solutions

## Problem
The `.pkl` file was created with a different FastAI/Python environment than what's currently installed, causing pickle loading errors.

## Solution 1: Re-export the Model (RECOMMENDED)
In your training environment (where you created `mango_diseases.pkl`), run this code:

```python
# Load your trained model
learn = # however you loaded it originally

# Export with explicit settings for compatibility
learn.export('/path/to/mango_diseases_v2.pkl')

# Or if that doesn't work, try:
import torch
torch.save(learn, '/path/to/mango_diseases_v2.pkl', pickle_protocol=4)
```

Then replace the `mango_diseases.pkl` in the project root with the new file.

## Solution 2: Match the Training Environment Exactly
Tell me:
1. What Python version did you use to train? (run `python --version` in training env)
2. What FastAI version? (run `pip show fastai` in training env)
3. Did you use Google Colab, Kaggle, or local machine?

## Solution 3: Use ONNX Export (More Compatible)
If possible, export to ONNX format which is more portable:

```python
# In your training environment
import torch.onnx

# Get a dummy input
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # adjust size as needed

# Export
torch.onnx.export(
    learn.model,
    dummy_input,
    "mango_diseases.onnx",
    export_params=True,
    opset_version=11,
    input_names=['input'],
    output_names=['output']
)
```

Then I'll modify the backend to use ONNX Runtime instead.

## Quick Test
Can you run this in your TRAINING environment and share the output?

```python
import sys
import fastai
import torch
print(f"Python: {sys.version}")
print(f"FastAI: {fastai.__version__}")
print(f"PyTorch: {torch.__version__}")
```
